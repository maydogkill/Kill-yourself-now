        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of fucking Satan.

            It is the worst meme possibly conceived, if you can even consider it a meme. It is so unbelievably wretched and cretinous to where anyone over the age of 5 knows that it is terrible. It was created by some guy on Youtube or smnth. The meme is so terrible and absolutely fucking atrocious that it makes me, and several other groups of people want to rip their eyes out. The meme has been going for way to long, similar to another terrible meme, the "Ohio Meme". Both of these fucking memes are so horrendous. Little children also try to say this meme has lore, but it doesn't. at all.
            The fanbase of this meme consists of little crusty iPad kids who aren't even potty-trained yet. This meme is largely on Youtube Shorts, which is a detestable internet landscape that is also a rip-off of TikTok.
            Seriously this meme is so absolutely disgusting.
            i, and everyone else on the internet other than those infants on YT shorts agrees, that this is the worst thing ever.

                    <p>The Frying Pan is a promotional melee weapon for all classes with the exception of the Engineer and the Spy. It is based on the Frying Pan from the video game Left 4 Dead 2; a seasoned cast-iron skillet with a small dent on the underside.

                        This weapon functions identically to the wielder's default melee weapon, but with an added cosmetic function: upon contact with a surface or player, it plays pan weapon sounds from Left 4 Dead 2.
                        
                        Using Strange Bacon Grease on this item gives the user a Strange variant.
                        
                        This item, together with Ellis' Cap, is awarded to players who own Left 4 Dead 2.

                <p>Your Eternal Reward is a community-created melee weapon for the Spy. It is a long, ornate dagger with distinctive oriental designs, a team-colored wooden handle, and a curved golden hilt. The other side of the handle, when holding the knife, has a crack in it.

                    This weapon retains the instant-kill backstab ability of the Knife, but with some tweaks. Upon a successful backstab, the Spy instantaneously disguises as the target without the puffs of smoke that usually surround a disguising Spy. Furthermore, the victim does not scream upon death (although there is still the actual noise of the backstab per se), nor does a death notice appear in the enemy team's kill feed. Also, the corpse of the victim fades away almost instantly as if cloaking (unless that user has the Bombinomicon equipped, then there is the exploding death effect with no fade). Finally, the Spy does not use any voice responses, including lines for dominations, on a successful backstab to prevent drawing unnecessary attention. The process is so quick and unnoticeable that the Spy is never revealed between disguises. Therefore, Sentry Guns are unable to target the Spy between backstabs, making it easier to backstab unaware Engineers and sap their buildings. Upon backstabbing someone who is being healed by a Medic, the healing beam is automatically transfered to the Spy. The player still retains the ability to change and reload their disguise weapon, as with the Disguise Kit. Altogether, backstabs become much more difficult to track, as victims disappear silently with the Spy instantly taking their place in battle.
                    
                    However, the disguise effect is not activated if the target does not die from the backstab; namely, if the target is wearing a Razorback or is invulnerable. Non-backstab kills achieved do not grant the Spy the victim's disguise and the kill appears in the killfeed, but the kill is still silent and the corpse of the victim disappears.
                    
                    Non-backstab disguises cost an entire Cloak meter (outside of spawn) and can only be done if the Cloak meter is full and if the user is not cloaking, while disguises from backstabs consume no Cloak at all. The Cloak drain rate is also increased by 33%. This penalty affects the Dead Ringer to a lesser degree due to its innate cloak duration bonus. If L'Etranger is equipped, the drain penalty is nullified and the cloak duration bonus of L'Etranger is halved.
                    
                    If the player backstabs an enemy Spy who is currently disguised as a member of the player's team, the player does not receive the disguise of the player's own team member, and instead disguises as the enemy Spy.
                    
                    Taunting with Your Eternal Reward equipped results in the Fencing kill taunt. Kills made are silent and the victim's corpse disappears. However, the disguise effect is not activated even if the taunt hits the victim's back.
                    
                    In Mann vs. Machine, the Your Eternal Reward undisguises before applying the disguise. This causes the robots to still target you.</p>

                <p>Hailing from an indeterminate region of France, the Spy is an enthusiast of sharp suits and even sharper knives. Using a unique array of cloaking watches, he can render himself invisible or even feign his own death, letting him infiltrate enemy lines with little chance of detection. His Disguise Kit lets him impersonate any class on either team. With enough skill in the art of deception, the Spy can momentarily fool enemies with his disguise, lulling them into a false sense of security. When the time is right, he can emerge from the woodwork to strike a killing blow, stabbing his unsuspecting "teammate" in the back. A backstab with any of the Spy's knives will kill most foes in a single hit — provided they are not under the effects of any type of invulnerability.

                    In addition to being able to swiftly assassinate key enemies, the Spy can disable and destroy Engineer-constructed buildings with his Sapper. Once attached, the Sapper disables and slowly drains health from the enemy building, eventually resulting in its destruction. However, a Sapper can be removed by an Engineer, or Pyro wielding the Homewrecker, Maul, or Neon Annihilator.
                    
                    The Spy has the unique ability to use enemy Dispensers while disguised, and use enemy Teleporters at any time, enabling him to replenish his health and ammo behind enemy lines and enter Engineer nests undetected. Should any enemy be unfortunate enough to be standing on a Teleporter exit as the Spy teleports, they will be telefragged and die instantly. However, the Spy still collides with enemy buildings, even when disguised.
                    
                    Medics can both heal and apply ÜberCharge effects to disguised enemy Spies. Particularly adept Spies can use this to their advantage by coercing enemy Medics into healing them, allowing him to more easily pull off stabs amidst a group of enemies.
                    
                    Whereas most players can only see the names and health of their teammates, the Spy can observe the names and health of the enemy team as well (an ability unique to the Spy and a Medic carrying the Solemn Vow), allowing him to relay useful intelligence and coordinate team pushes. This synergizes well with his cloaking ability, which makes him ideal for identifying and calling out enemy positions and upcoming pushes. A skilled Spy can apply pressure from behind the enemy whilst the rest of his team pushes from the front, resulting in a pinch that any uncoordinated team will find difficult to escape from.
                    
                    The Spy is voiced by Dennis Bateman.
